== Data Considerations and Related Recommendations

=== The Role of an SDI

A Health SDI can be leveraged to address challenge in healthcare today, such as what issuing surrounding maternal mortality present. An ideal approach to rectify the problem can be to develop a GML-based spatial data infrastructure for health data that will standardize the semantics and definitions of data being captured and reported.  This will facilitate both integration of data from different sources and comparison of results reported from different health systems and nations.  

A spatial data infrastructure will also allow the health data to be easily mapped – and layered against social determinants of health, including but not limited to population density, education, income, transportation, environmental factors, climate change, and a variety of other factors. In addition, an SDI will enable the inclusion of new data sources that currently aren’t considered when analyzing health outcomes, such as environmental sensors, smart city sensors, and satellite data. This will allow more data and more diverse data to be brought to bear on health data analytics that was previously possible – leading to more comprehensive research into and discovery of both the root causes and solutions to adverse outcomes that plague our global community.  


=== Conceptual model recommendations

The INSPIRE report https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/documents/conceptual-model-developing-interoperability-specifications-spatial-data-infrastructures[A Conceptual Model for Developing Interoperability Specifications in Spatial Data Infrastructures], especially on pages 40, 46, and 52 of the report provides important mode recommendations for services data and data harmonization:

* *Download Service Strategies* - To make data available through a download service, data is typically transformed offline to create a static view that is compliant with the interoperability target specification and respecting privacy laws. Alternatively, data can be transformed inside the download service ‘on-the-fly’, according to previously defined mapping rules. A third option is to use a separate transformation service that executes predefined or user-defined mapping. It should be the responsibility of each data provider to choose the method and enable the necessary data transformation according to this choice.

* *Harmonized Schema and Use Cases* - Pursuing the principle that the SDI should bring together existing data, requirements from use case scenarios should be compared with existing ‘as-is’ data availability. This analysis can reveal whether the requested data can be supplied by the data providers. If so, it also shows the complexity of the related transformation work. If there is no one-to-one relationship between the proposed harmonized schema and the theme-related datasets, data integration might be still required at the level of the data sources or by the users. An example of a harmonized model is shown in Figure 1 of Chapter 3 of this White Paper.

* *Controlled Vocabularies* - Health data systems should put efforts on using common controlled vocabularies. Control vocabularies might be required for treatment names and codes, environmental conditions, etc. Exiting controlled vocabularies are:

=== Functional areas recommendations

Building a framework requires to partition the data needs in functional requirements. The suggested functional areas are as follows:

* data collection
* data access
* data processing
* data publication and sharing
* data visualization and decision support
* data privacy and protection
* data discovery
* semantic rich metadata
* data from sensors

=== Data recommendations

* *Data Security* - Data stored whether locally or in a cloud environment needs to be highly secure (critical applications) and comply with legal constraints.
* *Data Anonymization* -  Aggregated data needs to be anonymized at an appropriate level, considering national regulations on aggregation of health data at given scales. ISO provides https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:25237:ed-1:v1:en{ISO 25237:2017(en)Health informatics — Pseudonymization} as a potential method for privacy protection of personal health information of data within national borders as well as for transnational communication. 

** *De-Identification* - In the context of U.S. Federal health care regulation, the https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/index.html[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)] provides https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/special-topics/de-identification/index.html[guidance] on methods for de-identification of protected health information (PHI). https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/18/2017-00719/confidentiality-of-substance-use-disorder-patient-records[Protection] is also afforded to patients receiving treatment for substance abuse and mental health disorders. The https://publications.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/3e485e15-11bd-11e6-ba9a-01aa75ed71a1/language-en[General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR)] is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy for all individual citizens of the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA). It also addresses the transfer of personal data outside the EU and EEA areas. 

** *Data Suppression* - Data is suppressed and omitted from data analytics and visualization when N<10, e.g., when there are less than 10 patients in a ZIP code. At times, data is suppressed when N<11, in other words, an N of 10 is also suppressed.  This is to ensure de-identified data cannot be easily re-identified. 

* Data Harvesting – By following OGC open data standards, an SDI enables the harvesting of data sets that are stored in different locations. This expands the accessibility and availability of data without duplicating the overhead associated with data storage and management.

* Data Analysis – Numerous tools can be made available through and housed on an SDI for the purposes of analyzing data to provide decision support and predictive capabilities – as well as pre-processing the data.  This can be as simple as a filter (such as to visualize ony those postal codes where the population exceeds 10,000 individuals) and as complex as machine learning-based artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms (such as a regression analysis to predict future adverse health events, such as a maternal mortality).
